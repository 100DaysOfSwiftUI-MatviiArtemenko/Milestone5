> *Your goal is to build an app that asks users to import a picture from their photo library, then attach a name to whatever they imported. The full collection of pictures they name should be shown in a `List`, and tapping an item in the list should show a detail screen with a larger version of the picture.</br>*

## &nbsp; 🎖 Challenge
> Breaking it down, you should:
> + Wrap `PHPickerViewController` so it can be used to select photos.
> + Detect when a new photo is imported, and immediately ask the user to name the photo.
> + Save that name and photo somewhere safe.
> + Show all names and photos in a list, sorted by name.
> + Create a detail screen that shows a picture full size.
> + Decide on a way to save all this data.

> * Your first step should be to examine the JSON. The URL you want to use is this: https://www.hackingwithswift.com/samples/friendface.json – that’s a massive collection of randomly generated data for example users.
